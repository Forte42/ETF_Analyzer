# ETF Analyzer

In this notebook, I build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## Technologies

This code was written on Windows 11 running python 3.9.12. It also uses Pandas (1.4.2), Jupyterlab (3.3.2), hvPlot (0.7.3), and SQLAlchemy (1.4.32). I also made a webapp on my local machine using Voila (0.2.16)

## Installation Guide

Pandas, hvPlot, Jupyterlab, SQLAlchemy, and Voila can all be installed using the pip install function.

## Usage

This notebook was made to practice using SQL to explore databases and analyze a fictional FinTech ETF. I also made a local WebApp using Voila. Here are some pictures!
